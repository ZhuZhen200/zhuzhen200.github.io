## About Me

Hi! This is Zhu Zhen, a passionate student currently pursuing a MSc in Mechanical Engineering at Tsinghua University. My interests lie in **intelligent manufacturing**, **robotic dynamics**, and **precision manufacturing**. Recently, I’ve been involved in several research projects focused on **robotic milling**, **surface topography prediction**, and **chatter suppression**.

I completed my bachelor’s degree at **Tianjin University** with a focus on **mechanical engineering**. In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy participating in **cultural exchanges**, sports like **basketball**, and **traveling** to explore new places.
